									<h4>Professional Life:</h4>
									<p>Beginning the study of piano in Minneapolis at age three, and the oldest of four children, Colton Peltier grew up practicing. He entered and succeeded in many local competitions, and began attending the <strong>Aspen Music Festival and School</strong> at the age of 10, returning almost every year. Colton has earned his Master of Music degree at The <strong>Juilliard School</strong> where he studied with <strong>Yoheved Kaplinsky.</strong> He has graduated from Juilliard with his Bachelor of Music degree as well, where he also studied with Dr. Kaplinsky.<br><br>

									Colton made his orchestral debut at a very young age and has since performed a dizzying array of piano concerti with important orchestras. He first performed <strong>Beethoven’s Piano Concerto no. 1</strong> with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra with Marlene Pauly conducting. He was immediately re-engaged the following year performing <strong>Saint-Saens’s Carnival of the Animals.</strong> Ms. Pauly also brought him to the Grand Teton Music Festival. <br><br>

									Colton rehashed Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue multiple times with the Minnesota Orchestra, Osmo Vӓnska conducting. Mr. Vänska reengaged him with the same piece for a Sommerfest Concert the following summer. Rhapsody in Blue also brought him to the Des Moines Symphony, Joseph Guinta conducting. Colton performed Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 20 with the Kenwood Symphony. Now a teenager, Colton tackled Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto no. 1 with the Lamont Symphony in Denver, Lawrence Leighton Smith conducting. Timothy Muffitt brought him to the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra for performances of Grieg’s Piano Concerto no. 1 and Rachmaninoff’s Variations on a Theme of Paganini. Mr. Muffitt reengaged Colton the following year for Chopin’s Piano Concerto no.1 with the Lansing Symphony Orchestra. Colton has presented Liszt’s Piano Concerto no. 1 with the Evanston Symphony, Southeast Iowa Symphony, and the South Arkansas Symphony. He performed Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto no. 1 with the Southeast Iowa Symphony. <br><br>

									He played Shostakovich’s Piano Concerto no. 2 with the Lake Superior Chamber Orchestra. He performed Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto no. 2 with the American Conducting Academy at Aspen Orchestra, as well as the South Arkansas Symphony. He has also collaborated with Gianandrea Noseda and the Juilliard Orchestra as well as Eric Jacobsen and the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra for performances of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto no. 3. Of his 2014 performance of Chopin’s Piano Concerto no. 1 with the Lansing Symphony, the Lansing City Pulse states, <i>“The best thing about Peltier was his relaxed, assured flow . . . every time the orchestra started to thunder like a parent laying down the law, Peltier eased in, brushed off the bluster and calmly took care of business, as if to say, ‘Chill, I got this.’”</i><br><br>

									In addition to Colton’s many concerti appearances, he has also performed extensively as a soloist. Some highlights include his performance in the <strong>South Arkansas Art Center recital series</strong>, which included Schubert’s Sonata in C minor, D. 958, Ravel’s “La Valse”, Rachmaninoff’s Sonata no. 2, and Lowell Liebermann’s “Gargoyles”. He presented works such as Beethoven’s Sonata op. 3 no. 2, Schumann’s “Faschingsschwank Aus Wien”, Debussy’s “Pour le Piano”, and Liszt’s “Dante Sonata” in the Snowmass Chapel Concert Series. he performed at the Governor’s Round Table gala in Aspen, CO; “From the Top” 10 year anniversary show in Granville, OH; for the "Friends of the Library" recital series in Rancho Mirage, California; and the Virginia Waring Black and White Ball honoring Carlo Ponti Jr.<br><br>

									Colton has participated in numerous competitions most recently winning the Juilliard Concerto Competition, Aspen Conducting Academy Piano Competition and the Virginia Waring International Piano Competition.</p>
